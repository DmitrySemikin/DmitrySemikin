- 👋 Hi, I’m Dmitrii Semikin (@DmitrySemikin)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, obviously... well... lately it was Java (all applications) and C++ (for scintific calculations and visualisation).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever is needed.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well... try LinkedIn, it should work most likely.
